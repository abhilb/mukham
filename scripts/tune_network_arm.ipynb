    "Other Tips\n",
    "----------\n",
    "1. During the tuning, the auto-scheduler needs to compile many programs and\n",
    "   extract feature from them. This part is CPU-intensive,\n",
    "   so a high-performance CPU with many cores is recommended for faster search.\n",
    "2. You can use :code:`python3 -m tvm.auto_scheduler.measure_record --mode distill -i log.json`\n",
    "   to distill the large log file and only save the best useful records.\n",
    "3. You can resume a search from the previous log file. You just need to\n",
    "   add a new argument :code:`load_log_file` when creating the task scheduler\n",
    "   in function :code:`run_tuning`. Say,\n",
    "   :code:`tuner = auto_scheduler.TaskScheduler(tasks, task_weights, load_log_file=log_file)`\n",
    "4. If you have multiple target CPUs, you can use all of them for measurements to\n",
    "   parallelize the measurements. Check this `section <tutorials-autotvm-scale-up-rpc-tracker>`\n",
    "   to learn how to use the RPC Tracker and RPC Server.\n",
    "   To use the RPC Tracker in auto-scheduler, replace the runner in :code:`TuningOptions`\n",
